# Signup and Login system: 

This project is a simple sign up and login system where I implemented **OOP** and **MVC**. I also used **Templating** , this was possible with the aid of **output buffering** no dependency was used just raw **PHP** and **PSR-4** autoloading and namespacing.

You can easily start the project from the **public** folder with the php command : **php -S localhost:9000** or any host and port number you will rather use.

At the point of writting this I am still working on an e-commerce project, so fill free to check the project **e-commerce** if it is available in my repo .
